People use different languages but there is something everyone has in common. Everyone enjoys the refreshing taste of Mockito!

### Python ###

So, your favorite pet is a snake? Check out Serhiy Oplakanets' [Mockito-Python's Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/mockito-python/) site.

### Flex ###

Ok, you're a flexible one. You might be interested in Krzysztof Karczmarczyk's [Mockito-flex](http://bitbucket.org/loomis/mockito-flex/wiki/Home).

### Javascript ###

Excellent, welcome to the cool kids. Take a sip of Chris Leishman's [jsMockito](http://jsmockito.org).

### Scala ###

My friend Phil Wills, the guardian of Guardian, informs that two dominant Scala testing frameworks, [Scalatest](http://doc.scalatest.org/1.9.1/index.html#org.scalatest.mock.MockitoSugar) and [Specs](http://code.google.com/p/specs/wiki/UsingMockito) have some syntactic sugar support for Mockito.

### Objective C ###

Jon Reid brewed a nice port for the bitten apple developpers. Taste it at [OCMockito](https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito)'s place.

### Perl ###

Two entries in the Perl menu.

  * Spencer P uses Perl to serve the best coctails. Check out [Pockito](http://search.cpan.org/search?query=test::Pockito).
  * Steven Lee offers a different mix with the aroma of [Test::Mocha](https://metacpan.org/module/Test::Mocha).

### PHP ###

Even the notorious web developers know what to drink to keep smiling. The [Phockito](https://github.com/hafriedlander/phockito) is brought to you by Hamish Friedlander.

### MATLAB ###

Mathematicians will certainly enjoy https://github.com/vperic/mmockito by Vladimir PeriÄ‡.
