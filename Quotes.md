**Stack Overflow** community-accepted answer to [What's the best mock framework for Java?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22697/whats-the-best-mock-framework-for-java) is Mockito.

**Dan North**, the originator of BDD, about [the workshop](http://jaoo.dk/presentation/Test+Driven+Development) at [JAOO 2008](http://jaoo.dk) conference:

> It was a 'late substitution'. We decided during the main conference that we should use JUnit 4 and Mockito because we think they are the future of TDD and  mocking in Java ;)

**Ola Bini**, core developer of JRuby, in article [Java and mocking](http://olabini.com/blog/2008/07/java-and-mocking):

> We have been using Mockito for testing which is a first for me. My immediate impression is quite good. It's a nice tool and it allows some very clean testing of stuff that generally becomes quite messy.

**Hamlet D'Arcy** on his [blog](http://hamletdarcy.blogspot.com/2008/03/mockito-new-mock-framework-on-block.html):

> Mockito really cleans up the unit test by not requiring expectations. Personally, I much prefer the Mockito API to the EasyMock API for that reason.

**Technophilia** on Mockito's [Most helpful stacktrace](http://srivaths.blogspot.com/2009/02/mockito-coolest-stacktrace.html):

> "....Now, I think Mockito has taken over the mantle of the King of error messages. Just as my swooning over Mockito was at its zenith, I encountered the following stacktrace...."

> "....How cool is that! Hats off Mockito-team. This developer appreciates the extra few minutes you took to put together that message. It helped me immensely...."

**Zach Shaw** compared [EasyMock vs Mockito](http://zdsbs.blogspot.com/2009/01/easymock-vs-mockito.html):

> The google testing blog just published an article Use EasyMock I guess I just disagree. Mockito grew out of EasyMock, and I think they took a great library and made it even better, so I really think the title of the post should have been 'Use Mockito' not EasyMock. Anyway... there's a whole lot more that Mockito does check out the examples and get off the EasyMock and start drinking the Mockito :P

**Dhalia Bock** calls to [drink that Mockito!](http://dahliabock.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/drink-that-mockito-part-1):

> Do yourself and your team a favor and download Mockito and use it. Your sanity will thank you for it.

**Ketan Padegaonkar** on his [blog](http://ketan.padegaonkar.name/tag/mockito):

> This looks, and reads far better than the JMock syntax, and it was love at first sight; I'm test-infested now.

**Jay Fields** about [ubiquitous assertion syntax](http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/11/ubiquitous-assertion-syntax.html):

> In Java, the Mockito framework represents a step in the right direction, moving the mock expectations to the end of the test.

**Phil Wills** [blogged](http://scatterlogic.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/mockito-makes-you-think):

> Mockito makes you think

**alittlemadness.com** presents an article [about stubbing](http://www.alittlemadness.com/2008/06/12/easier-stubbing-with-mockito)

> The difference with Mockito is that stubbing and verification are separated (...) This separation works brilliantly when you donâ€™t want to verify everything by default
