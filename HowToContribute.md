# How to help #

  * If you know the answer to a question posted to our mailing list - don't hesitate to write a reply. That helps us a lot.
  * Also, don't hesitate to ask questions on the mailing list - that helps us improve javadocs/FAQ.
  * Please suggest changes to javadoc/exception messages when you find something unclear.
  * If you miss a particular feature in Mockito - browse or ask on the mailing list, show us a sample code and describe the problem.
  * Wandering what to work on? See [task/bug list](http://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/list) and pick up something you would like to work on. Remember that some feature requests we somewhat not agree with so not everything we want to work on :)
  * Mockito currently uses Github for versioning so you can **create a fork of Mockito in no time**. Go to the [github project](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) and "Create your own fork". When you're ready let us know about your pull request so we can discuss it and merge the PR!
  * Note the project now uses **gradle**, when your Gradle install is ready, make your IDE project's files (for example **`gradle idea`**). Other gradle commands are listed via **`gradle tasks`**.
