In past, the releases were made every several months proceeded by a number of release candidates. It didn't work very well because:

  * Some of you have to wait long for some fixes/features (like the OSGi stuff).
  * Release candidates let some bugs slip through anyway regardless of how long or how many RCs were there. This is mostly because very little users actually try out the release candidates.

Currently we release 'small releases' as often as needed even if it's just tiny little feature. Consider those 'small releases' as continuous release candidates for the 'big release' that will occur rarely, for example every several months.
